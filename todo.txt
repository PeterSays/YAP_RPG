Peter Says:
establish basic entity map behaviors, then start battles, then try out traveling through world

initialize factions when building world

both parties decide action before turns start, faster is much more likely to first
regular turns give access to every body part
extra turns are prompted at random after first move selection
extra turns more possible with very fast limbs, but may only use those limbs
turn order decided by average AGI across all body parts

hud

save session: acts as regular gamestate saving
save zone: marks loaded zone to store a copy of once unloaded, can be added to worlds during generation on new games
save character: saves a copy of the player object, isolated from current game associations, to be used next game

place entities and structures in a zone when loading, remove them all when unloading the zone
zone attributes like faction populations are edited while playing so that reloading the zone doesn't reset progress
when zone is loaded, its structures and entities are loaded into the session's entities/structures list

refactor to allow for pyinstaller with --onedir, don't allow any files outside of main.py to mention paths
